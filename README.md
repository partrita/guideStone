# Concept

1. Use large language model to make candidate of protein that your interest.
2. make list of mutants that maybe 1 point or multiple point mutation.
3. Use bunch of tools to predict property of mutants
4. Decision to proceed or not by score.
5. Make primer to site-directed mutagenesis.
6. Do some experiments to proof of concepts.
7. Done
